Evaluate the pricing explanation based on:
1. **Clarity**: Is the explanation clear and easy to understand?
2. **Completeness**: Does it break down all cost components?
3. **Transparency**: Are the calculations and factors clearly explained?
4. **Justification**: Is the pricing adequately justified?
5. **Customer-friendly**: Is it presented in a customer-friendly manner?

Rate from 1 to 5:
- 1: Poor (unclear, incomplete, not justified)
- 2: Below Average (missing key information)
- 3: Average (acceptable but could be better)
- 4: Good (clear and well-justified)
